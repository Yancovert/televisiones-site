# 📺 TeleVisiones - A Worker Cooperative

Welcome to the official repository for **TeleVisiones**, a worker cooperative founded by Alfie Watts & Sam Flores! This website is a unique digital space designed to showcase our creative endeavors, built with a minimalist aesthetic, striking visuals, and engaging UI features.

## ✨ Features

* **Immersive Visuals:** A static, full-screen background featuring our iconic microphone and "TeleviSiones" branding, setting a distinct tone.
* **Dynamic Scroll Effects:** Text elements and a jagged arrow move subtly as you scroll, creating a smooth parallax-like experience.
* **"New Athena Unicode" Font:** Custom typography applied throughout the site for a consistent and unique brand identity.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for seamless viewing on both mobile phones and desktop computers.
* **Engaging Loading Screen:** A custom loading spinner and message provide a polished introduction as content loads.
* **Interactive Cursor Trail:** A subtle, ethereal trail follows your mouse cursor, adding a unique and interactive touch.
* **Clear Information Layout:** Dedicated sections for our mission, team credits, and a scannable QR code for easy access.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get this website up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

You just need a modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari) to view the site. No special software is required beyond that.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the files):**
    If you're using Git, open your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    git clone [your-repository-url]
    cd televisiones-site
    ```
    If you downloaded a ZIP, extract it to your desired location.

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    Ensure your terminal or file explorer is in the `televisiones-site` folder, where `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` are located, along with the `assets` folder.

3.  **Open `index.html`:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. You can usually do this by double-clicking it.

    ```bash
    # Example for Linux/macOS users:
    xdg-open index.html # For Linux
    open index.html     # For macOS
    ```

That's it! The website should load, displaying the custom font, background, and interactive elements.
